# From-Data-to-Diagnosis-A-Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Predicting-Diabetes
This project uses machine learning to predict diabetes risk, comparing models like Gradient Boosting and Random Forest on metrics like accuracy and AUC. BMI emerged as a key predictor. The goal is to enable early intervention, improve health outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs through data-driven insights.
